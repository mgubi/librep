.SH NAME
rep \- Read, Eval, Print Interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrep\fR [ \fB FILE \fR ] [ \fB \-\-batch \fR ] [ \fB \-\-interp \fR ] [ \fB \-f, \-\-call FUNCTION \fR ] [ \fB \-l, \-\-load FUNCTION \fR ] [ \fB \-s, \-\-scheme FILE \fR ] [ \fB \-\-version \fR ] [ \fB \-\-no-rc \fR ] [ \fB \-q, \-\-quit \fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrep\fR `librep' is a dialect of Lisp,
designed to be used both as an extension language for applications and
as a general purpose programming language. It was originally written
to be mostly-compatible with Emacs Lisp, but has subsequently diverged
markedly. Its aim is to combine the best features of Scheme and
Common Lisp and provide an environment that is comfortable for
implementing both small and large scale systems. It tries to be a
"pragmatic" programming language.
